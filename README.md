# ModernC

Modern C by Jens Gustedt.

These are my solutions to the examples and challenges Jens set in his book.
It is my first concerted effort to learn the C language in it's modern form.

My aim is to have a record of a consistent effort to produce ever improving code
on a daily basis. I will in parallel be working through a book on discrete
mathematics. 

I aim to progress onto a book on algorithms and data structures. It will be
studied in parallel to my work on leetcode.

C will be the language of choice for me to program moving forward this year.
I aim to build several smaller projects that demonstrate an
appreciation for good architectural design and clean implementation. Having made
some progress with these I hope to create a networked system that demonstrates 
my ability to leverage code written by others. One that accounts for the
dynamics of open source development and the culture of particular projects.
